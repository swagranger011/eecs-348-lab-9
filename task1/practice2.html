        I can Talk English, I can walk English, I can Laugh English because English is a very Funny Language. Bhairo
        becomes Baron and Baron becomes Bhairo because there mind's are very Narrow. In the Year 1929 sir, when India
        was
        playing against Australia in Melbourne city, Vijay Merchent and Vijay Hajare, they were at the crease and Vijay
        Merchet told Vijay Hajare, look Vijay Hajare - This is a very Prestigious match and you must consider this match
        very carefully. So considering the consideration that Vijay Hajare gave Vijay Merchant, Vijay merchent told
        Vijay
        Hajare that ultimately we must take a run and when they were striking the ball on the leg side Sir, the
        consideration became into a ultimatum and ultimately Vijay Hajare went to Vijay Merchant.
        Similarly Sir. In the Year 1979, when India was playing against Pakistan in Wankhade stadium, Bombay, Wasim Raja and
        Wasim Bari they were at the crease and Wasim Bari gave the same consideration to Wasim Raja and Wasim Raja told
        Wasim Bari - look Sir, this ultimately has to end in a consideration which I cannot consider, therefore the
        consideration that you are giving me must be considered very ultimately. Therefore, the run that they were
        taking, Wasim Raja told Wasim Bari - Wasim Bari you take a run, and ultimately both of them ran and considerately
        they got out.
